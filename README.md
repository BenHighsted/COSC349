Assignment 1 for COSC349 at the University of Otago.

To use our timezone converter, simply clone the repository into a local directory, then type 'vagrant up'.
Once the build has finished, navigate to localhost:8080 to access the converter. 

If you wish to build older versions of the code, you will need to delete the .vagrant folder included
with the older versions.
